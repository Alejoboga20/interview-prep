## Big O Notation

[Resources](https://docs.silver.dev/interview-ready/technical-fundamentals/ctci/big-o-notation)

Definition: Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It is a measure of how quickly the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input grows. It is a way to describe the upper bound of the runtime of an algorithm.

_** There is another definition called Amortized Analysis, which is a way to describe the average runtime of an algorithm. **_

## Run code in terminal

You can run the code in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
ts-node <folder>/<filename>.ts
```
