# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming starts by solving subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem. Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint. You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems, and they don’t depend on each other

## Tips to implement dynamic programming

- It’s often useful to picture a dynamic programming problem as a grid.
- The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize. For the knapsack problem, the values are the value of the goods.
- Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems. That will help you figure out what the axes are.
