# Quicksort

Quicksort uses divide and conquer (D&C), a recursive technique. To use D&C, you need to follow three steps:

1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
2. Divide or decrease the problem until it becomes the base case.
3. Combine or conquer the problem.

**Tip When you’re writing a recursive function involving an array, the base case is often an empty array or an array with one element. If you’re stuck, try that first.**
