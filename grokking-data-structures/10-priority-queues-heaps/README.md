# Priority Queues and Heaps

A `priority queue` is a data structure that stores elements in a way that they can be retrieved in a sorted order. The elements are stored based on their priority. The element with the highest priority is retrieved first.

To implement a `priority queue` we need to implement two methods: `insert` and `extract_max` (or `top`).

The queue will always return the element with the highest priority. The priority can be defined based on the value of the element or based on some other criteria.
