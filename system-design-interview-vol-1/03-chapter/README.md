# A Framework for System Design Interviews

An interview about system design evaluates the following skills:

- Ability to design a system that meets specific requirements.
- Ability to communicate design ideas effectively, to collaborate with others, and to justify design decisions.
- Ability to think about trade-offs and make decisions based on constraints.
- Ability to reason about the system's behavior under different conditions.
- Ability to work under pressure and handle ambiguity.

It is also important to avoid the following common pitfalls:

- Focusing too much on technical details and neglecting the big picture.
- Over engineering the solution and adding unnecessary complexity.

# A 4 Step process to approach system design interviews

1. **Understand the problem and establish design scope**

- Answering without a proper understanding of the problem is a huge red flag.
- Ask questions to clarify requirements and assumptions (e.g., "What are the main use cases?", "Who are the users?", "What are the performance requirements?", "What kind of applications are we building?", etc).

2. **Propose a high-level design and get buy-in**

- Come up with an initial blue print of the system. Try to get buy-in from the interviewer before diving into details. Ask for feedback and iterate on the design as needed.
- Use a whiteboard or paper to sketch out the architecture and components of the system. This helps to visualize the design and communicate ideas effectively.
- Develop a few use cases and walk through them to ensure the design meets the requirements.

3. **Dive into the details of the design**

- Work with the interviewer to explore specific components of the system in more detail. This could include data models, APIs, algorithms, etc. Get a list of components and prioritize them based on their importance to the system.
- Try not to get into unnecessary details. Focus on the most important components and how they fit into the overall design.

4. **Wrap up and discuss trade-offs**

- Identify potential bottlenecks and challenges in the design. Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches to address these challenges.
- Never say your design is perfect. Always be open to feedback and willing to iterate on the design as needed.
